Nuget package is here: http://nuget.org/packages/angularjs

I created it because that I needed to use angular.js in two different projects, and keeping the files in sync with each new release was an ugly process: you need to download the new files, and than remove the version number from each file name. 

So I took the task on my self and created a NuGet package for this, which contain the files without the version number (-1.0.0) in the files names.

If you find any issue with it, please open an issue here: https://github.com/fitzchak/angular.js-NuGet/issues, or better yet, make a pull request.
